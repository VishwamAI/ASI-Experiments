# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation for ASI Project

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to set up the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the ASI project using GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the ASI system.

## Workflow Configuration
The CI/CD pipeline is configured using a GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/asi_ci_cd.yml`. The workflow is triggered on push and pull request events to the `main` branch and any branches matching the pattern `devin/**`.

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/asi_ci_cd.yml`
```yaml
name: ASI CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'devin/**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Verify pytest installation
      run: |
        pytest --version

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --maxfail=5 --disable-warnings

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        # Add deployment commands here
        # Example: scp -r ./project user@server:/path/to/deploy
```

## Steps in the Workflow

### 1. Checkout Code
The workflow starts by checking out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout@v2` action. This ensures that the latest code is available for the subsequent steps.

### 2. Set Up Python
The `actions/setup-python@v2` action is used to set up the Python environment. The workflow specifies Python version 3.8 for consistency across the development and deployment environments.

### 3. Install Dependencies
The workflow installs the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This step ensures that all necessary packages are available for the ASI system to function correctly.

### 4. Verify Pytest Installation
To ensure that `pytest` is installed correctly, the workflow includes a step to verify the installation by running `pytest --version`. This step helps to catch any issues with the installation process before running the tests.

### 5. Run Tests
The workflow runs the tests using `pytest` with the `--maxfail=5` and `--disable-warnings` options. This step executes the unit tests to verify the functionality and correctness of the ASI system.

### 6. Deploy to Production
If the build and tests are successful, the workflow proceeds to the deployment step. This step includes custom deployment commands to deploy the ASI system to the production environment. The example provided uses `scp` to copy the project files to a remote server.

## Conclusion
The CI/CD pipeline for the ASI project is designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the ASI system. By using GitHub Actions, the workflow ensures that the ASI system is consistently built and tested, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall development process.
