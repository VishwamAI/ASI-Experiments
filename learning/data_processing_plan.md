# Data Processing Component Plan

## Overview
The Data Processing component is responsible for analyzing and preprocessing the data fetched by the Data Ingestion component. This involves cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

## Steps and Technologies

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Objective**: Remove any inconsistencies, duplicates, or errors in the data.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas
- **Tasks**:
  - Identify and handle missing values.
  - Remove duplicate records.
  - Correct data types and formats.

### 2. Data Normalization
- **Objective**: Scale the data to a standard range to ensure uniformity.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tasks**:
  - Apply normalization techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.
  - Ensure all features are on a similar scale.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Objective**: Convert the data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tasks**:
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Generate new features through feature engineering.
  - Aggregate data if necessary.

### 4. Data Validation
- **Objective**: Ensure the processed data meets the required quality standards.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement validation checks to verify data integrity.
  - Generate summary statistics and visualizations to inspect data quality.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy.
   - Create a new Python file `data_processing.py` in the `learning` directory.

2. **Implement Data Cleaning**:
   - Define functions for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
   - Write unit tests to verify the correctness of these functions.

3. **Implement Data Normalization**:
   - Define functions for applying normalization techniques.
   - Write unit tests to verify the correctness of these functions.

4. **Implement Data Transformation**:
   - Define functions for encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and data aggregation.
   - Write unit tests to verify the correctness of these functions.

5. **Implement Data Validation**:
   - Define functions for validation checks and generating summary statistics.
   - Write unit tests to verify the correctness of these functions.

6. **Integrate with Data Ingestion**:
   - Ensure the Data Processing component can accept data from the Data Ingestion component.
   - Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of the Data Processing component as per the plan.
- Continuously test and validate each step to ensure data quality and correctness.
